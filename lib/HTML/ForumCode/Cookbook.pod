Method(s) to add to your own controller to ForumCodify some text and return

This is useful as part of a solution to provide in-page edit-preview toggling
(via YUI).

=item L<HTML::ForumCode::Cookbook::Recipe2> - HTML, JavaScript and CSS

The HTML and JavaScript required for taking a textarea and showing a preview
of the marked up HTML. Also includes sample CSS for the preview overlay.
